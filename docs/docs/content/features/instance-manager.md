# :fontawesome-solid-computer: Instance Manager

The Instance Manager provides a comprehensive view of all your RayforceDB instances, both local and remote.

## :material-content-save: Saved Instances and Folder Organization

Save frequently used remote instances for quick access. Saved instances are persistent, so you don't need to set them up every time you open VS Code.
