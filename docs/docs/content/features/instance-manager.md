# Instance Manager

The Instance Manager provides a comprehensive view of all your RayforceDB instances, both local and remote.

## Local Instances

The extension automatically detects running local RayforceDB instances on your machine. You can see:

- Process ID (PID)
- Port number
- Connection status
- Process information (CPU and memory usage)

## Saved Instances

Save frequently used remote instances for quick access. Saved instances are persistent, so you don't need to set them up every time you open VS Code.

## Folder Organization

Organize your saved instances into handy folders and subfolders:

- Create folders to group related instances
- Create subfolders for even better organization
- Drag and drop instances between folders
- Rename or delete folders as needed
